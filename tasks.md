- **Low**: Straightforward implementation, well-documented patterns

## Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Must be implemented for basic system functionality
- **Core**: Important for full system operation but not blocking
- **Additional**: Enhances system but not essential

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Critical Tasks)
- Estimated Timeline: 2-3 months
- Focus on voice recognition and system integration
- Set up basic database and caching

## Notes
1. Tasks should be implemented in order of priority
2. High-difficulty tasks should start early to allow for iterations
3. Regular testing required throughout implementation
4. Documentation should be maintained alongside development
5. Performance metrics should be established early
6. Security considerations should be addressed in each phase
